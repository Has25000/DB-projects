# DB-projects

## Overview
This project is a fun and educational game that simulates ordering a pizza. It was created to teach basic programming concepts, geometry, and pre-algebra through an interactive experience.

## Files
- **pizza.py**: The main game file where the pizza ordering logic is implemented.
- **learn_basics.py**: A file containing basic Python concepts and examples used for learning.

## What the Game Does
In the `pizza.py` file, the game allows the player to:
- Choose the size of the pizza (small, medium, large).
- Select toppings for the pizza.
- Decide how many slices to cut the pizza into.
- Calculate the area and perimeter of the remaining pizza after some slices are eaten.

## Educational Value
- **Programming**: Introduces basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Geometry**: Teaches concepts like area and circumference using the context of a pizza.
- **Pre-Algebra**: Reinforces understanding of variables and basic arithmetic operations.

## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the files are located.
4. Run the game by typing `python pizza.py` and pressing Enter.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding how to use loops and conditionals in programming.
- Learning about geometric calculations in a real-world context.
- Practicing input and output operations in Python.
